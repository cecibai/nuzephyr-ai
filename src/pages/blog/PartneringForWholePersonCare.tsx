      content="Whole-person care requires whole-system collaboration. This summer, we partnered with a behavioral health platform to embed NuZephyr's intake and documentation modules into their virtual clinic. The result: faster onboarding, cleaner SOAP notes, and real-time escalation for high-risk cases. Our modular architecture made integration seamless, and our shared commitment to inclusive care made it meaningful. This is what partnership looks like â€” modular, mission-aligned, and clinically grounded."
