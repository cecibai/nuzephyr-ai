      content="Modularity isn't just a technical choice — it's a care philosophy. At NuZephyrHealth.ai, every module is designed to stand alone, integrate seamlessly, and adapt to diverse workflows. Whether it's intake, triage, documentation, or engagement, our architecture allows providers and platforms to license only what they need, deploy rapidly, and maintain clinical integrity across every touchpoint. This flexibility is what makes NuZephyr scalable across solo practices, enterprise platforms, and payer ecosystems. We believe modularity is the future of intelligent care — and we're building it now."
