      content="Designing for healthcare isn't about aesthetics — it's about trust, clarity, and clinical logic. At NuZephyr, we treat every pixel as a product decision. Our UI reflects SOAP structure, triage urgency, and supervision workflows because providers deserve tools that think like they do. We prototype in Figma, validate with clinicians, and iterate until the interface disappears and the care logic shines through. Clinical precision isn't a feature — it's our foundation."
